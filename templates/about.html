				<h1>Hi,</h1>
				<p>
					This is a little gallery I put up for those instant photos,
					which you may be lucky to already have one. :)
				</p>
				<p>
					Feel free and <a href="{% url upload %}">upload</a> yours
					to the <a href="{% url gallery %}">gallery</a>! If you want,
					you can place the photo on a map, and also write something
					little along with it.
				</p>

					to make it as easy as possible.
